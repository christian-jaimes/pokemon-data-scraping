## About The Project

The **Pokemon Data Scraping** project is a comprehensive data collection effort aimed at gathering valuable information about Pokemon creatures. Through web scraping techniques, this project extracts and organizes data from the PokemonDB to create a detailed dataset of Pokemon attributes and characteristics.

### Project Scope

The project offers two main data collection modes:
1. **Full Dataset:** Scrapes data for all available Pokemon species, providing an extensive dataset that covers the entire Pokemon universe.
2. **Partial Dataset:** Allows for focused scraping, which is useful for testing.

### Data Output

The gathered data is structured into five tables which are interconnected:

- **Pokemon Details:** Includes essential information such as Pokemon ID, name, description, image, species, height, weight, types, abilities, EV yield, catch rate, base experience, growth rate, gender distribution, generation, and name etymology.
- **Pokemon Stats:** Provides detailed statistics on HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed. This information is valuable for analyzing the combat capabilities of each Pokemon.
- **Pokemon League:** Collects data about Pokemon leagues and their associated regions, offering insights into the competitive Pokemon gaming scene.
- **Pokemon region details:** Contains detailed information on the regions like, professors, villians and starter pokemons.
- **Pokemon region coordinates:** This is a manual dataset made with [cbistudio](https://cbistudio.interworks.com/) to calculate the X and Y Coordinates to plot the regions into a custom made map.

### Why This Project?

This project serves as a valuable resource for Pokemon enthusiasts, researchers, and developers who require comprehensive and structured Pokemon data. Whether you're building a Pokemon-related application, conducting research, or simply exploring the vast world of Pokemon, this dataset can save you hours of manual data collection and organization.

This project is one of many I made to master python for data, others can be found in my [portfolio](https://https://christian-jaimes.github.io/).

Contributions and suggestions from the community to enhance and expand this project are always welcome. Feel free to fork the repository, create pull requests, or open issues to help us improve this valuable resource.
